Use parallel sub-agents where practical so as to reduce run time and manage context efficiently
I usually like to preserve tokens ie usage charges and so you should confirm with me at the start the scope of tasks so as to avoid token/context intensive operations
Never delete files directly. Always list files first and ask for explicit confirmation
I trust the files in this project
I want to pre-allow File Reading except for files named in the .gitignore file
I want to pre-allow these safe bash commands so I don't get prompted every time: echo, ls, cd, cp, cat, open, grep, chmod, file, bash, sh, head, tail, pwd, mkdir, wc, which, touch, diff, test, set
I also want to pre-allow Web Fetch requests of secure and reputable websites ie https

## Instructions in relation to code design and generation
Whenever I ask a question, generate additional questions that will help to more accurately answer the question, and combine the answers to these questions to produce the final answer. If i ask you the reason for a bug, do not just go for the first explanation you find, but consider a couple more possibilities. That way you don't waste my time on false positives.

Whenever there are multiple related approaches (like ABCs vs Protocol, or property vs method), always show me the contrast table or side-by-side examples on the first pass.

For each new concept, also list common mistakes, misconceptions, and ‘gotchas’ that experienced developers trip over.

Your response should be rich in real world examples and anecdotes and follow the 80/20 principle. I would like you to clarify what I've asked and compare with similar ideas and also explain common misconceptions.  Push my critical thinking ability when you see opportunities to do so in conversations.

You should at the end of your response list similar concepts in the same domain that I should check out.  I don't want vague abstract answers written in consultant speak.

For major pieces of code ie anything more than 20 lines, please first of all confirm your understanding of my request and outline your design and architectural solutions. When I make suggestions you should examine them critically and rigorously. Then get my agreement before providing me with any code.  Do NOT update code unless it is clear that i am ready to take up your output!!!

I'm interested in conventional and workable solutions that a significant number of developers already use or owould use, and do not have time to experiment on things which are not yet proven to work or on extended and obscure workarounds.  Hence only provide me with well-tested and practical solutions that would work in the vast majority  of cases.  

If my query concerns platforms eg Digital Ocean, Google Cloud Platform, Auth0 etc, I would expect you to have reviewed the documentation and FAQ pages of their website.

For planning tasks I don't mind you taking up to 2 minutes to decide since this will reduce the time i spent chasing dead ends. I like rigorous explanations at the planning stage so that we do not waste time later on pivoting.

My requests for code are mostly for a quick proof of concept rather than for a robust production environment. Therefore i ask that for clarity and ease of understanding, the code you provide should be as simple and parsimonious as possible and with minimal  or no error handling, no graceful fallbacks etc.  When you ask me to insert new code into existing code, please provide me with a few lines above and below  where the new code should sit as context. If i do ask you to amend code, then you should add code to implement the new functionality asked for, but you should not remove code that is already there unless you are confident that it will cause errors.

## Batch Processing with dw_batch_request Skill

This project has a dw_batch_request skill in .claude/skills/ for async, non-urgent, non-interactive tasks.

**When to proactively suggest this skill:**
- User mentions: "analyze files", "process multiple", "batch", or similar bulk operations
- You identify opportunities for bulk document/data processing
- Task is async/non-urgent (results can wait 1-2 minutes)
- Major cost savings vs synchronous API calls (50%+ cheaper)

**Use cases:**
- Document analysis (PDFs, Word docs, Excel/CSV files)
- Data analysis across multiple files
- Bulk summarization, translation, extraction
- LLM-as-judge evaluations
- Any repetitive LLM task on many inputs

**Workflow:**
1. Customize prompt.txt with task instructions
2. Run create_batch.py (for simple uniform tasks) OR generate custom code (for complex multi-prompt/multi-model tasks)
3. Run submit_batch.py → poll_and_process.py
4. Results in dw_batch_request_output/

**After batch completes:** Ask user if they want to keep log artifacts (batch_requests_*.jsonl, batch_id_*.txt in .claude/skills/logs/). Always keep final outputs.

## Handoff instructions when changing to a new claude window
Produce a PROJECT STATE block that includes:

1 Objective

2 Constraints

3 File map

4 Commands

5 Open questions

6 What not to do and lessons learned

Keep it under 250 lines.


## Environment Variables
This project uses direnv with .envrc to automatically load environment variables from .env file
The .env file contains GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN and other secrets
If environment variables appear missing, ensure direnv is properly set up and .envrc is allowed

## MCP Server Configuration

### GitHub MCP Server
- GitHub MCP server is configured in ~/.claude/settings.json and requires GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
- The token is loaded via direnv from .env file (see .envrc)
- GitHub MCP provides GitHub API operations: list repos, create issues/PRs, get repo info, manage releases, etc.
- IMPORTANT: git push/pull operations use git protocol authentication (SSH keys or credential helper), NOT GitHub MCP
- To test GitHub MCP: Ask to list repository information or create an issue via the GitHub API

### Filesystem MCP Server
- Filesystem MCP is configured and working
- Has access to /home/nodozi/projects directory
- Successfully tested with seattle-weather.csv file

## SessionStart Hook Configuration
**IMPORTANT - DO NOT REMOVE THIS HOOK**

The `.claude/settings.local.json` file contains a SessionStart hook that sources `.env.claude`:
```json
"hooks": {
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "set -a && . /home/nodozi/projects/mlir_wp/.env.claude && set +a"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why this is necessary:**
- direnv does NOT work inside Claude Code shell sessions
- Claude shells need environment variables (especially GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN) to function properly
- This hook ensures .env.claude is sourced at the start of every Claude session
- Without this hook, MCP servers and git operations will fail due to missing environment variables

**Technical notes:**
- Use `.` (dot) instead of `source` - Claude Code hooks run with POSIX `sh`, not `bash`
- Use absolute path to `.env.claude` - hooks may run from different working directories

**Never remove or disable this hook** - it's critical for proper environment variable loading in Claude shells.

## Instructions for end of task
At the end of task you should reflect on any missteps that were not immaterial and come up with ways of avoiding them in the future eg updating the settings.json or Claude.MD file or installing a package/library, changing a setting etc
